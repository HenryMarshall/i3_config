i3 Configuration
================

The configuration files for my quad-head i3 setup.

**DEPENDENCIES**
[i3ipc-glib](https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-glib) - A C interface library to i3wm
[gir_ffi](https://rubygems.org/gems/gir_ffi) - Ruby interface for C library

**NOTE**
RVM user: be aware that i3 uses your system installation of ruby. Make sure you install the dependencies there.

**TODO**

* j4 shenanigans
* default workspace locations
* launcher mode
* lock/suspend/shutdown
* conky
* customize i3bar


**IDEAS**

* run script to hide cursor on workspace focus shift
* command to feed spec results to i3bar
